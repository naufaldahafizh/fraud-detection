# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset is not included in this repository due to its size (>100MB).  
You can download it from the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

Place the file as: "fraud-detection/data/creditcard.csv"

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: EDA and modeling in Jupyter
- `src/`: Reusable Python modules (e.g., preprocessing)
- `sql/`: Optional SQL exploration
- `README.md`: End-to-end documentation

## Goal

Predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not using features such as amount, time, and PCA components.
